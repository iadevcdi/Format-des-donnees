Cher monsieur Boukadoum,

Je voulais juste vous informer que je me concentre actuellement sur la pratique et la maîtrise de YOLO et ViTPose, conformément à vos recommandations. 
J'apprécie vraiment les conseils donnés. 
Je travaille sur la partique de ces outils afin de les appliquer de manière efficace dans mon projet.

Bonne journée !
